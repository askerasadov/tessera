# Git and GitHub Workflow

This document captures the operational detail of how code lands in this project. The critical rules are summarized in [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md); the steps and command-level detail live here.

The branching model is **GitHub Flow**: `main` is the trunk and is always shippable. Feature work lives in short-lived branches off `main`, returns via pull request, gets reviewed, and merges back. There is no long-lived `develop` branch, no release branches, no hotfix branches. A future need (e.g., maintaining 0.x while 1.x is in development) can introduce one if it earns its keep, not before.

---

## Branch Naming

Branches are named for what they contain:

- **`feature/<short-description>`** — new functionality, e.g., `feature/validator`, `feature/td2-parser`.
- **`fix/<short-description>`** — bug fixes, e.g., `fix/check-digit-overflow`.
- **`docs/<short-description>`** — documentation-only changes, e.g., `docs/align-illustrative-shapes`.
- **`chore/<short-description>`** — build, tooling, dependency bumps, repository maintenance.

Names are descriptive enough that a reviewer reading the GitHub PR list knows what the branch is about without opening the PR.

### Worktree Default Branches

Claude Code worktrees auto-generate branch names like `claude/confident-albattani-6f0935`. **Rename before pushing** — the auto-generated name is meaningless to reviewers. From inside the worktree:

```sh
git branch -m claude/confident-albattani-6f0935 feature/<descriptive-name>
```

The worktree directory keeps its original name; only the branch reference changes.

---

## Per-PR Workflow

The standard flow when starting work on a new feature or fix:

### 1. Create the branch off latest `main`

```sh
git fetch origin
git checkout -b feature/<descriptive-name> origin/main
```

If you're in a worktree that already has a branch checked out, either rename that branch (above) or create a new one off `origin/main`.

### 2. Make the changes

Edit code, write tests, update relevant feature docs and ADRs as commitments are made or discovered. Per [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) Documentation Sync rules, doc updates are part of the slice, not a follow-up.

### 3. Update `CHANGELOG.md`

Every non-trivial PR adds entries to the `[Unreleased]` section, grouped per [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) categories: `Added`, `Changed`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`, `Fixed`, `Security`. Trivial PRs (typo fixes, single-character edits) can skip the changelog with an explanation in the PR description.

When `0.1.0` is tagged, the `[Unreleased]` section becomes `[0.1.0] - YYYY-MM-DD` and a new `[Unreleased]` section is opened.

### 4. Run the private-content scan

**Required before every push to a public-or-soon-to-be-public remote.**

The exact grep command and the user-curated list of terms live in memory `feedback_private_content_scan.md` — not duplicated here, so this file does not itself become a hit when the scan runs over the repo. Look up the memory entry and run the command from there.

Expected output: nothing, or only the documented false positives. Anything else is a real leak — stop and flag.

The documented false positives:

1. **`InvalidData`** in `docs/features/mrz-error-taxonomy.md` — substring `idda` matches the scan but the word is a generic English term, not private context.
2. **`"Azerbaijan"`** in `mrz-core/src/commonMain/.../recognition/CountryCodeTable.kt` — the ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 English short name, standard data identifier treated identically to USA / GBR / DEU / etc. The convention is about prose / comments / docs, not standard data identifiers.
3. **`azerbaij.pdf`** in URL anchors pointing to the Library of Congress ALA-LC romanization document (`https://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/romanization/azerbaij.pdf`) — primary citation source for the AZE transliteration profile. The filename is what LoC chose; the URL is a citation, not authored prose. Used in `docs/decisions/0009-transliteration-profiles.md`, `docs/features/transliteration.md`, `docs/open-questions.md`.

### 5. Run verification

Doc-only PRs:

```sh
bash scripts/check-cross-references.sh
```

Code PRs:

```sh
./gradlew spotlessApply build
bash scripts/check-cross-references.sh
```

The build runs spotless, ktlint, all unit tests, and property tests. All must pass before push.

### 6. Commit

Per the existing commit-message style: short imperative subject, blank line, body explaining the *why*. Use HEREDOC for the body to preserve formatting. Always include the Co-Authored-By trailer for commits Claude makes:

```sh
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
Short imperative subject

Body explaining what changed and why. The why is more valuable than
the what; the diff already shows the what.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
```

### 7. Push

```sh
git push -u origin feature/<descriptive-name>
```

The `-u` sets upstream tracking so subsequent pushes work without arguments.

The `gh` CLI is set up as a Git credential helper in this environment (via `gh auth setup-git`), so HTTPS pushes work without prompting for credentials.

### 8. Open the PR

```sh
gh pr create --base main --head feature/<descriptive-name> \
  --title "<concise PR title>" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
<PR description following the template at .github/pull_request_template.md>
EOF
)"
```

The template has these sections:

- **Summary** — 1-3 sentences on what the PR does and why.
- **Documentation Impact** — every doc the PR touches or should touch.
- **Tests** — what was added, total count, any flakiness.
- **Open Questions Touched** — items in `docs/open-questions.md` resolved, modified, or added.
- **Changelog** — confirm `CHANGELOG.md` `[Unreleased]` is updated.
- **Verification** — checklist (`./gradlew build`, cross-references, private-content scan, branch name).

When pushing from `gh pr create` directly, the template body needs to be passed via `--body`. The template at `.github/pull_request_template.md` is what fills in if a PR is opened via the web UI; for CLI creation, paste the relevant sections in `--body`.

### 9. Review

If a reviewer is involved, request review via `gh pr edit <pr> --add-reviewer <handle>` or assign on GitHub. Address comments via follow-up commits on the branch (don't squash-rebase mid-review unless requested — preserves comment threads against specific commits).

### 10. Merge

Merge strategy preferences (default is GitHub repo settings; can be configured per-PR):

- **Rebase and merge** — preserves individual commits on `main`, linear history. Recommended when commits are well-titled and tell a coherent story.
- **Squash and merge** — collapses to one commit on `main`, hides intermediate steps. Recommended when commits are messy or "WIP" style.
- **Merge commit** — preserves all commits + a merge commit indicating where they joined. Useful for clearly bounded feature branches.

After merge:

```sh
# locally, off the now-deleted feature branch:
git checkout -b <next-branch-name> origin/main   # new work
# or
git switch main && git pull                      # back to trunk
git branch -d feature/<descriptive-name>         # delete the merged local branch
```

GitHub auto-deletes the remote branch if "Automatically delete head branches" is enabled in the repo settings.

---

## Worktree Cleanup

If the work was done in a Claude Code worktree, the worktree directory remains after the branch is deleted. Clean up from outside the worktree:

```sh
# from main checkout (not from inside the worktree):
git worktree remove .claude/worktrees/<worktree-name>
```

Or let Claude Code clean up automatically when the next session creates a new worktree (default behavior).

## Notes for Future AI Sessions

- **`gh` CLI is installed and authed** in this user's environment as of 2026-05-04. Future sessions can push and create PRs from the session itself; no need to ask the user to do it manually unless something has broken.
- **`gh auth setup-git`** is the bridge between Git's HTTPS push and `gh`'s credentials. Without it, `git push` will hit "could not read Username for 'https://github.com'" even when `gh auth status` shows logged in.
- **PR template** at `.github/pull_request_template.md` auto-applies to web-UI PR creation. For CLI creation, the body is provided explicitly via `--body` — paste the template sections in.
- **CHANGELOG-on-every-PR** is the discipline. The PR template has a checkbox; future sessions should default to updating the changelog rather than treating it as optional.
- **Private-content scan** is mandatory before every push to a public-or-soon-to-be-public remote. The grep terms are user-curated and live in memory `feedback_private_content_scan.md`. The documented false positives are listed under "Run the private-content scan" above (`InvalidData` in `mrz-error-taxonomy.md`; `"Azerbaijan"` as ISO 3166-1 data in `CountryCodeTable.kt`; the `azerbaij.pdf` URL filename in ALA-LC citation links). None count as leaks.
